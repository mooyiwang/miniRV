LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell u_miniRV/u_control/pcbja_sel_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) u_miniRV/u_control/pcbja_sel_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
